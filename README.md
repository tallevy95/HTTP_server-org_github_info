Junior SW Engineer - Home Assignment

	In this assignment, I was requested to write an HTTP server that provides information about
	a GitHub organization's repositories.


Description:
	
	- approach_1.py will generate a data.csv file that contains the wanted information (more on that later).
	- approach_2.py will generate a HTTP server using Flask that contains the wanted information (more on that later).

	The wanted information:
	- Name
	- Owner
	- URL
	- Creation Time
	- Number of stars

Installation:
	
	1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tallevy95/project-name.git`
	2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
	3. Run the project: `python approach_i.py  <Organization> <Phrase>` for i= 1,2
	<Organization> is a must; <Phrase> is an option (has to be in length 3 or more)

Usage:
	
	To use this project, follow these steps:
		1. run the selected approach as mention above.
		for approach_1:
		2. open the csv file in the directory of the program.
		for approach_2:
